\section{Stack Attacks}
\subsection{Stack Frame}
\subsubsection{Construction}
The steps needed to call a function and construct a new stack frame are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Push the last argument to the top of the stack;
  \item Push the first argument onto the stack;
  \item Push the return address onto the stack;
  \item Jumping to the called function;
  \item Saving the caller's base pointer on the stack;
  \item Move the base pointer to the top of the stack
  \item Allocating local memory for the callee.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Destruction}
The steps needed to seamlessly return and resume the execution of the parent
(caller) function are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Moving the stack pointer to the bottom of the callee's frame (value of
  \texttt{ebp})
  \item Restoring the caller's base pointer by popping it
  \item Taking the return address off the stack and jumping to it
  \item Freeing space allocated for the callee arguments
\end{enumerate}
